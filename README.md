# Moodle Task Viewer for Ruppin 🎓

Moodle Task Viewer for Ruppin is a Google Chrome extension designed to improve the academic workflow of students at Ruppin Academic Center by providing a clear, accessible, and efficient task-tracking panel directly inside the Moodle platform.

The extension helps students monitor assignments, deadlines, and task statuses without navigating through multiple Moodle pages, making academic task management simpler and more intuitive.

## 🎯 Motivation

While Moodle is a powerful Learning Management System, tracking assignments often requires navigating multiple sections and pages.  
This extension was built to centralize task visibility, reduce friction, and help students stay organized and on top of their academic responsibilities.

- Relevant task and assignment data is extracted from the page structure
